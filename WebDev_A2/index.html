                    <h2>Yalta and Potsdam conferences</h2>
                    <p>Towards the end of World War 2, allied powers comprising of Britain, the United States of America
                        (USA), and the Soviet Union engaged in talks to discuss how the war-torn Europe. These talks
                        were held in Yalta and Potsdam. During the talks, conflicts arose between the leaders of the USA
                        and the Soviet Union. The leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, felt distrustful of the USA
                        due to how the USA withheld information of the atomic bomb from the Soviet Union despite their
                        alliance. The USA on the other hand, feared the spread of communism and did not trust the Soviet
                        Union. This thus caused the Yalta and Potsdam conference to play a critical role in
                        deterioriating the relationship between the USA and the Soviet Union, which is why some
                        historians argue that the Potsdam conference was the start of the Cold War. However, despite the
                        Soviet Union promising to hold free and fair elections in the Eastern Bloc, they turned the
                        countries into Soviet satellite states.</p>

                    <h2>Iron Curtain</h2>
                    <p>On March 5th 1946, Winston Churchill gave the famous Iron Curtain speech. In this speech,
                        Churchill talked about the dangers of the spread of communism and how dangerous the Soviet Union
                        is. Churchill suggested in this speech that America and Britain must stand up against the the
                        communist threat and protect European countries near the eastern bloc from communist influence.
                        This was the first speech where a major politician had talked about the threat of communism and
                        it had greatly heightened tensions between the USSR and the USA, thus leading to some historians
                        saying it was the start of the Cold War.</p>

                        <h2>Cuban Missile Crisis</h2>
                        <p>In August 29th 1949, the Soviet Union successfully invented their own atomic bomb, leading
                            the USA and the Soviet Union to have an arms race against each other. The USA had stationed
                            missiles in Turkey between 1961 and 1962, which due to how close Turkey was to the USSR,
                            caused the USSR to feel threatened. Following the communist revolution of Cuba, America
                            attempted various operations to try and remove Cuban dictator Fidel Castro from power.
                            However, these failed attempts caused Cuba to turn to the USSR for protection.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The USSR responded to Cuba's plea by stationing soviet missles in Cuba, making America feel
                        threatened. This lead America to enfore a naval blockade around Cuba, preventing soviet ships
                        from entering Cuba without an inspection. This had escalated tensions between both sides,
                        causing the leaders of both countries to try and negotiate a deal before an all out nuclear war
                        broke out. In the end, the leaders from both countries were able to successfully come to an
                        agreement, with the USA and the Soviet Union pulling out their missiles from Turkey and Cuba
                        respectfully.</p>
