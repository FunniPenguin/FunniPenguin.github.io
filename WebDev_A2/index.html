                            <p>On the other hand, the <strong>Soviet Union made lots of promises in the conferences

                        <li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>USA had <strong>stationed nuclear missiles in Turkey</strong>, causing the <strong>Soviet
                                    Union to feel threatened.</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>USA's close neighbour, Cuba, <strong>changed its leader to communist dictator Fidel
                                    Castro</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fearing the spread of communism into the USA, the <strong>USA tried to invade
                                    Cuba.</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>However, the USA was <strong>not successful</strong> and Cuba, feeling threatened by the
                                USA, <strong>decided to ask Russia for protection.</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>An <strong>spy-drone caught images of Soviet missiles in Cuba</strong>, causing the USA
                                to panic.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>This caused America to <strong>enforce a naval blockcade of all soviet ships into
                                    cuba</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>This caused tensions to escalate quickly and the <strong>USSR almost fired a nuclear
                                    missile at the USA</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>However, both sides managed to come to a deal in time. <strong>USA and USSR agreed to
                                    pull out their missles from Turkey and Cuba respectively</strong></p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Korea entered into a <strong>civil war</strong> after WW2 between the <strong>communist

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The USA, <strong> the spread of communism</strong> in Asia, decided to back South Korea.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The South Koreans with the help of US forces nearly managed to push the North Koreans

                        <li>
                            <p>This made the Soviet Union and China <strong>fear that if the North Koreans fell, they

                        </li>

                            <p>Stalin approved China's involvement in the war, pushing the US-backed South Koreans back

                            <p>Similar to the Korean war, the Vietnam war was a battle between, <strong>the communist

                        </li>
